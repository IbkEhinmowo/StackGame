## Features

- **Procedurally generated levels:** With shifting directions and varying block sizes, no two games are the same.
- **Realistic physics:** Utilizes Cannon.js for true-to-life block interactions and a touch of unpredictability.
- **Overhang mechanics:** Master the art of placement to maximize your score, but be wary of collapse!
- **Progressive difficulty:** As your tower grows taller, the challenge scales.
- **Minimalist aesthetic:** A clean, pleasing color palette offers a distraction-free environment.

## How to Play

1. Click or tap at the precise moment to drop a moving block onto the tower.
2. Aim for maximum overlap between the new block and the previous one.
3. Smaller overlaps make for smaller bases, leading to tougher placements as you ascend.
4. The game ends when a block falls off the tower.

## Getting Started
